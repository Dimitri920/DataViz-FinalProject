# DataViz-FinalProject
We wanted to look at regional youtube data to provide a map of where the most popular videos are. We also want to look at some comparison analysis between regions using different visualizations/tables (other than the map). We will try to have a display that shows the most popular videos, number of views, number of comments, and also how to differentiate between different Youtube videos such as education/entertainment/music videos/etc.
